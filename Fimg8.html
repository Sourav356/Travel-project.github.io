                Kollam (Malayalam: [kolːɐm] (listen)), also known by its former name Quilon[10] pronunciation (help·info)(sometimes referred to by its historical name Desinganadu[11]), is an ancient seaport and city on the Malabar Coast of India bordering the Laccadive Sea, which is a part of the Arabian Sea.[12] It is 71 km (44 mi) north of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram.[13] The city is on the banks of Ashtamudi Lake and the Kallada river.[14][15][16] Kollam is the fourth largest city in Kerala and is known for cashew processing[17] and coir manufacturing.[18] It is the southern gateway to the Backwaters of Kerala[19] and is a prominent tourist destination.[20] Kollam is one of the most historic cities with continuous settlements in India.[21][22][23] The Malayalam calendar (Kollavarsham) is also known so with the name of the city Kollam.[11] Geographically, Quilon formation seen around coastal cliffs of Ashtamudi Lake, represent sediments laid down in the Kerala basin that existed during Mio-Pliocene times.<br>

                <br>Kollam has a strong commercial reputation since ancient times. The Arabs, Phoenicians, Chinese, Ethiopians, Syrians, Jews, Chaldeans and Romans have all engaged in trade at the port of Kollam for millennia.[26] As a result of Chinese trade, Kollam was mentioned by Ibn Battuta in the 14th century as one of the five Indian ports he had seen during the course of his twenty-four-year travels.[27][28] Desinganadu's rajas exchanged embassies with Chinese rulers while there was a flourishing Chinese settlement at Kollam. In the ninth century, on his way to Canton, China, Persian merchant Sulaiman al-Tajir found Kollam to be the only port in India visited by huge Chinese junks. Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller, who was in Chinese service under Kublai Khan in 1275, visited Kollam and other towns on the west coast, in his capacity as a Chinese mandarin.[29] Kollam is also home to one of the seven churches that were established by St Thomas as well as one of the 10 oldest mosques believed to be found by Malik Deenar in Kerala.
